**Delete Account Policy**

At Vishwa Technological Solutions, we respect your right to control your personal data. If you no longer wish to use the MyFlatInfo platform, you have the option to request account deletion. This Delete Account Policy outlines the conditions, process, and implications associated with deleting your account.

**1. User-Initiated Deletion**

- You may initiate a request to delete your MyFlatInfo account at any time by contacting your BA Building Admin or emailing us at support@myflatinfo.com.
- All deletion requests are subject to approval by your respective BA Building Admin for verification and administrative purposes.

**2. Verification and Approval**

- To ensure account security and community compliance, deletion requests must be verified by the BA Building Admin before being processed.
- The BA Building Admin may take up to 30 days to review and approve your request, after which your data will be removed from the system.

**3. Data Removal Scope**

- Once approved, your personal data (including name, contact information, apartment details, payment history, and preferences) will be permanently deleted from the active system.
- Certain transactional or financial records may be retained for compliance with legal and accounting regulations.
- Visitor logs and system logs related to your account will be anonymized or retained for a limited period as per security protocols.

**4. Limitations and Restrictions**

- Account deletion cannot be reversed. Once your data is deleted, it cannot be recovered.
- If you are a part of active society operations (e.g., a committee member), the deletion request may be subject to additional review.
- Pending payments, unresolved complaints, or ongoing legal matters may delay or restrict deletion until resolution.

**5. Deletion During Trial or Subscription**

- You may request account deletion during the trial period without any obligations.
- If deletion is requested after a paid subscription has started, it will follow the Cancellation Policy and may not qualify for a refund unless it aligns with the policy conditions.

**6. Contact Information**

- For all account deletion-related queries or assistance, please contact us at support@myflatinfo.com.

Vishwa Technological Solutions is committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data responsibly throughout the deletion process.
